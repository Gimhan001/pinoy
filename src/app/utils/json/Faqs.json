        "description": "Airline tickets are paid for in full at the time of booking and in case of cancellation, we reserve the right to charge an administration charge, on top of which, the airlineâ€™s charges will also apply. Please also note that some airlines may treat a name change as a cancellation and as such will not refund any funds. When the outbound segment of your flight is not used the return segment will be automatically cancelled by the airline and no right to a refund exists for such partly used tickets."
